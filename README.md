# Belly Button Challenge

This project uses data from a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset to create an interactive dashboard that displays various visualizations of the data.

## Project Overview

This project uses javascript, plotly and d3 to build a dynamic web dashboard that allows users to explore data on bacteria cultures found in the human belly button. The dashboard uses a bar and bubble charts to visualize the distribution and prevalence of over 2300 microbal species among participants.
