# Belly Button Challenge

This project uses data from a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset to create an interactive web application that displays various visualizations of the data.

## Project Overview

This project uses javascript, plotly and d3 to build a dynamic web dashboard that allows users to explore data on bacterial species found in the human belly button. The dashboard uses a bar and bubble charts to visualize the distribution of bacterial species and their prevalence in different samples.
